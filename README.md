Predicting Diabetes using Python Machine Learning
This project is used to predict the chances of getting Diabetes.
This project is developed using machine learning modules such as numpy, pandas,
matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn, train_test_split, LinearRegression, accuracy_score,
LogisticRegression, GaussianNB, KNeighboursClassifier, tkinter.
User have to enter the glucose value and insulin value, then this model will predicit the chances of getting Diabetes.
